# Overview

As a cybersecurity specialist, I wanted to expand my skill set by learning JavaScript and understanding how web applications work at a fundamental level. 
Having a strong grasp of web technologies is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, conducting security assessments, and understanding attack vectors in modern web applications. 
This portfolio website serves as both a learning project to master JavaScript fundamentals and a professional platform to showcase my cybersecurity projects and skills.I created a fully responsive personal portfolio website using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities and how it interacts with web browsers. As a cybersecurity professional, understanding how JavaScript handles user input helps me better assess web application security.

# Development Environment

I developed this project using Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor.

The software is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Canvas API for particle animations
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

# Useful Websites
