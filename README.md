# Overview

As a cybersecurity specialist, I wanted to expand my skill set by learning JavaScript and understanding how web applications work at a fundamental level. 
Having a strong grasp of web technologies is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, conducting security assessments, and understanding attack vectors in modern web applications. 
This portfolio website serves as both a learning project to master JavaScript fundamentals and a professional platform to showcase my cybersecurity projects and skills.I created a fully responsive personal portfolio website using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. 
The site features smooth scrolling navigation, animated background effects using the Canvas API, intersection observer for scroll-triggered animations, and dynamic DOM manipulation. By building this from scratch without frameworks, I gained hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts including ES6 syntax, event handling, object-oriented programming, and browser APIs—all of which are essential knowledge for understanding client-side security risks.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities and how it interacts with web browsers. As a cybersecurity professional, understanding how JavaScript manipulates the DOM, handles user input, and manages client-side logic helps me better assess web application security, identify potential XSS vulnerabilities, and understand the attack surface of modern web applications. This project demonstrates practical application of JavaScript while building a tool I can use professionally.

# Development Environment

I developed this project using Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor.

The software is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Canvas API for particle animations
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

# Useful Websites

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helpful guides for CSS animations and layouts
- [Canvas API Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) - Essential for understanding particle animation implementation

# Future Work

- Add security headers analysis and display security scores
- Create a projects section specifically for cybersecurity tools and demonstrations
